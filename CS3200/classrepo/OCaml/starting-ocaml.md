# Starting with OCaml

Follow the instructions in
[the OCaml book](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html)
to install OCaml on your system. If VSCode isn't your cup of tea,
don't worry; a high-quality OCaml plugin is likely available for your
favorite editor as well (e.g., merlin for emacs and vim). The following is just a list of reminders for what needs to be done. Follow the book for the actual commands.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ocaml opam
opam init
# Be sure to create an opam switch
opam switch create cs3200 ocaml-base-compiler.5.0.0
opam install dune utop qcheck alcotest qcheck-alcotest sexplib ocamlfind lwt num
opam env                             ## Just to see what's in that env
eval $(opam env)
dune test

eval $(opam env)                     ## run this whenever a new shell is started 
```

## Install QCheck and Alcotest

Our programming assignments will depend on the QCheck and Alcotest
libraries for automated testing, which can be installed via opam with
the following command if they are not already installed:

```
opam install qcheck alcotest qcheck-alcotest sexplib
```

## OCaml Documentation

Once our programming assignments get going, you may often find OCaml's
[online documentation](https://v2.ocaml.org/api/) to be useful.

## Hello World!

```
let x : int = 3200 in
let _ = print_string("Hello World!\n") in
let _ = print_string("from CS") in
let _ = print_int(x) in
  print_string("\n")
```

```
changliu@TABLET-B433GV92:/mnt/c/Users/msg4c/root/cs3200/ocaml$ ocamlc test.ml
changliu@TABLET-B433GV92:/mnt/c/Users/msg4c/root/cs3200/ocaml$ ls
a.out  test  test.cmi  test.cmo  test.ml
changliu@TABLET-B433GV92:/mnt/c/Users/msg4c/root/cs3200/ocaml$ ./a.out
Hello World!
from CS3200
changliu@TABLET-B433GV92:/mnt/c/Users/msg4c/root/cs3200/ocaml$ 
```

Here's an extended version of the HelloWorld program.

```
(* This Hello World program shows several styles of OCaml printing and string/int manipulation. *)

let x : int = 3200 in
let _ = print_string("Hello World!\n") in
let _ = print_string("from CompSci") in
let _ = print_int(x) in
  print_string("\n");
  print_string("from CS " ^ string_of_int x ^ "\n")
```  


```
let rec fibonacci n =
  if n < 2 then n else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2) in

let fib = fibonacci 10 in

let _ = print_int(fib) in
  print_string("\n")  
```
