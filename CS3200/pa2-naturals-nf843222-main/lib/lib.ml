(** The natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, … start briskly at 1 and then go on
    forever, although how we might explain what it means for anything 
    to go on forever without in turn using the natural numbers is something
    of a mystery. In almost every respect, they are, those numbers,
    simply given to us, and they express a primitive and
    intimate part of our experience. ~ David Berlinski, *A Tour of the Calculus* *)

(** PART I (Natural numbers):

    Recall that the natural numbers can be given by the following
    inductive definition:

    1) O (zero) is a natural number (despite what the above quote says).

    2) If n is a natural number, then S n (the successor of n) is a
       natural number.

    3) The only natural numbers are those generated from 1) and 2).

    We can encode the natural numbers in OCaml with the following
    datatype (note that the zero constructor 'O' is a capital 'o'). *)
type nat =
  | O
  | S of nat

(** PART II (Binary‑encoded numbers): *)

(** The usual inductive definition of the natural numbers induces a
    *unary* encoding. While convenient for its simplicity (especially
    for doing proofs by induction), a unary encoding of numbers is
    woefully inadequate for large‑scale computation.

    The problem, for one, is that the size (and thus memory usage) of a
    nat is linearly proportional to the value of the nat itself. I.e.,
    the nat representation of 2 requires literally twice as much memory
    as the representation of 1, 3 requires three times as much as 1, and
    so on.

    Moreover, the running time of common operations can scale even
    worse than linear (e.g., your implementation of 'mult' above
    probably runs in time proportional to the product of n and m). *)

(** You may be wondering: “Computer hardware uses a *binary* encoding
    of numbers. Why can’t we do that”? The answer is that we can.
    Consider the following type 'pos' of binary‑encoded positive integers: *)
type pos =
  | H
  | O of pos
  | I of pos

(** The type 'pos' has three constructors, 'H', 'O', and 'I'. They can
    be understood as follows:

    * 'H' stands for 1.
    * 'O n', the 'O' constructor applied to a pos n, stands for 2 * n.
    * 'I n', the 'I' constructor applied to a pos n, stands for 2 * n + 1.

    This interpretation of pos is codified by the function 'int_of_pos': *)
